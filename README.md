# Check-It

#### Project Idea: 

The idea is to create an Android / iOS app. 
After creating an account in the app, the users can create various types of checklists in it. 

###### Checklists as daily (or weekly or monthly) planner. 
 - Can be created and updated anytime.
 - Recurring checklists can also be created. 
 - In case of recurring checklists, at the beginning of the day (or week or month) the entire list will get unchecked.
 - Users will check the items once they are done.  
 - At the end of the day (or week or month), it will show how many tasks were completed and how many are left. According to this data, the success percentage will also be provided. 
 - At the end of a month the app will show an overall success percentage based on the completion of each and every checklist used throughout the month.
 - Checklists with no deadline can also be created which will not be considered while calculating the success percentage.

###### General Features:
 - All the checklists can be updated at any time. 
 - Items in a checklist as well as an entire checklist can be deleted anytime. 
 - Reminders can be added to specific items. 
 - Checklists for a specific time in future can also be created. 
 - All the data will be stored against an account rather than a local host. So, the app can be used on various devices simultaneously. 

###### Tools to be used: 
- Frontend: React Native 
- Backend:  Node Js 
- API: Express Js 
- Database: MongoDB
